                        </h2>
                        <p>Dosh Alley is a free website service that provides a Savings Account comparison application and additional content such as articles to help secure your financial future.
                            </p>

<p>It was started by a young individual name Connor, a passionate web programmer who eventually delved into the world of Australian finance. 
                        </p>
    <p>
    The biggest influences for Dosh Alley were <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/0730324214/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=1211&creativeASIN=0730324214&linkCode=as2&tag=doshalley-22&linkId=0dc3650c14a6aab119c10e7d4d5394aa" target="_blank">The Barefoot Investor</a>, an Australian money guide that was easy to understand. Connor eventually learnt the importance of good money behaviours and thus Dosh Alley was born.</p>
